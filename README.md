# Decision Tree Classifier Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier for a classification problem. The primary objective is to classify data points into distinct categories based on the provided features. This project showcases the capabilities of decision tree algorithms in handling non-linear relationships and generating interpretable models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features and target labels that represent a classification problem. Key details include:

- **Features**: [Specify feature names here, e.g., age, income, education level]
- **Target Variable**: [Specify target variable, e.g., class or category]
- **Size**: [Specify the number of records and features]
- **Source**: [Provide dataset source or description]

## Data Preprocessing

Key steps in preparing the dataset include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing or removing missing entries to ensure data integrity.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw features into meaningful representations.
3. **Data Normalization**: Scaling the features for better model performance.

## Model Development

The Decision Tree Classifier was implemented with the following steps:

1. **Model Training**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Parameters like maximum depth, minimum samples split, and criterion (e.g., Gini or entropy) were optimized.
3. **Visualization**: The decision tree was visualized to understand splits and classifications.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model was assessed using:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the classifier.
- **Precision**: Correctness of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability to identify all relevant instances.
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

## Results

[Summarize the results, e.g., "The model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test dataset with a well-balanced precision and recall."]

## Conclusion

The Decision Tree Classifier provided an interpretable and effective solution for the classification task. Future improvements may include implementing ensemble methods such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for enhanced performance.
